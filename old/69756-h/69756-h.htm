<p class="drop-cap">The Robin Red-breast is a
very pretty and social bird,
and particularly fond of mankind.
See here he is! Pretty
creature, he will come into our
houses, and pick up whatever
he can find. And it will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
wrong to put him into a cage,
as he makes himself so good a
companion without such confinement.
The little Robin Red-breasts
covered the dead children
in the wood; and every
body ought to love them.</p>

<p>Yet there was a naughty boy
once who tried to catch a poor
Robin, as he was hopping about,
picking up the crumbs. The
bird escaped, and got upon a
rail; but the boy in pursuing
him, fell down, and hurt himself
so much, that he kept his
bed for a fortnight; a just punishment
for his want of hospitality.</p>

tender than the love of a
mother to her child. Here is
the nursery. Do but observe
with what care the fond parent

<p>You were such a little creature

you ought to make amends for
it, by being good and dutiful,
for those who are otherwise come

which you will find in the next

<p class="drop-cap">Sally was a little girl of
whom her parents were
too fond, and even her nurse,
when she was in arms, let her
have all she cried for, and so she
cried for almost every thing;
thus she was early spoiled, chiefly
because she was pretty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>As she grew up she proved
more and more obstinate, she
behaved sullen, and would pout
for hours, nay, sometimes for a
whole day, about some trifle,
while not any body could tell
what was the matter. In short,
she grew so very naughty, that
her parents were obliged often
to correct her severely. She
was only more sullen for it.
At last she was so wicked to
run away from her father and
mother; but in going through
a meadow, she was pursued by
a mischievous bull, and though
she escaped from him, and got
home again, yet she was so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
frightened, that she was subject
to fits ever after.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">There were a number of
children, who were all
school-fellows, got together to
play, when the squire of the
parish coming that way, gave
them some money for fruit and
cakes, and desired they would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
divide what they bought with
all their companions. Now
Master and Miss Fairchild, who
belonged to the party, happening
then to be absent, these greedy
children would not share what
they had got with them when
they returned. While they were
complaining how hard this was,
the squire happening again to
come by, reproved them for their
behaviour, and said he would
report them to their school-master;
but he invited Master Fairchild
and his sister to his own
house, where he feasted them
with puddings, pies, and all
sorts of niceties; but not one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the greedy children was admitted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Exercise is good for
health, and therefore sports
which keep the limbs in motion
are proper for children; but
they should be careful to use
such as are safe. Charley Careless
and Sukey Hairbrain suffered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
for want of minding this
maxim. They were fond of
swinging on a rope, and their
parents thought the exercise did
them good; but having once
neglected to fasten it properly,
down they came, and were much
hurt, and still more frightened.
This was very heedless, and as
pretty as the sport had seemed,
it hindered them from using it
for the future.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Tommy Trueby was a
good and sensible boy, who
never played the truant, nor
kept company with naughty
children. He did not like tossing
up, nor chuck-farthing, because
he thought it might lead
him to love gaming when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
was grown up. But he liked
very well to play at ball, and
top, and more particularly at
marbles; at which he was very
clever; never cheated, and played
so well, that he used to teach
the neighbouring children.</p>

<p>And here you see him instructing
Master Manly, a Baronet’s
son in the place, as he
did in matters of more consequence;
and behaved so well
toward him, that he was his
friend all his life time.</p>

they meddle with gunpowder,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Tom Hazard (for example)
was always fond of playing with
serpents, crackers, &amp;c. At one
time he was near doing damage,
by his fire-works falling into a
cellar; and at another, as you
see in the cut, he so much frightened
one of his schoolfellows,
that he fell down and put his
ancle out; for which Tom was
severely corrected, and you must
own he richly deserved it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">When children are good
and dutiful, their parents
sometimes indulge them,
by taking them to see plays or
shows. Among these there are
few so diverting as the humours
of harlequin and the clown;
the one diverting you with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
wonderful leaps and changes,
and skipping about, as the other
does with his odd blunders and
grimaces; so that nobody can
help laughing at them. Here
they are both, and as pretty a
pair as you could wish. If you
behave well, no doubt but you
will see them often, if you are
not already acquainted with them.
In the mean time, I hope you
have been pleased with the <cite>Curiosity

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
